			<h2>LEGO NIGHT</h2>
			<p>LEGO Night is an annual event held by the Combustible Lemons. During LEGO
				Night, we invite kids from the 3rd to 7th grade to a LEGO Building
				Competition. The kids have to make creations that fulfill different tasks
				related to the night's theme, with every year having a different theme.
				Additional to the LEGO Building Competition, we have presentations and
				tables to give information about FIRST Programs in our town, and invite
				local FLL teams to demonstrate their robots alongside our own.</p>

			<h2>MOORESTOWN DAY / AUTUMN IN MOORESTOWN</h2>
			<p>Every year, our town hosts "Moorestown Day" and "Autumn in Moorestown,"
				events in which our main street is shut down and filled with booths for
				stores, organizations, and restaurants. Our team has held a booth at these
				events for the past four years, showing off our robot to our community. We
				offer the ability to drive the robot to kids, and offer face painting.</p>
