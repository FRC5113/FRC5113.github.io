**Just so you know the run file is very broken (I would not run it if you dont have a backup)**

To use this you first have to open the server that can be accompished with the following commands (assuming Windows, dont ask about bash, FIGURE IT OUT)

1. First open the server.js file and change the IP and port so it works
2. Then run npm install cors
3. Then run npm install express
4. Adjust your router settings if nesscary
5. Next run cd "scouting\backend"
6. Now do node server.js

You have started the server

Now have anyone who wants to use it get a scoutID and connect to that IP like this http://IP:3000

To look at the data run the following commands

1. cd "scouting\backend"
2. node dataVeiwer.js
3. Select the team name
