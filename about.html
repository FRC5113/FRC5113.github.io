        <b>Lego Night</b>
        <p>LEGO Night is an annual event held by the Combustible Lemons. During LEGO Night, we invite kids from the 3rd to 7th grade to a LEGO Building Competition. The kids have to make creations that fulfill different tasks related to the night's theme, with every year having a different theme. Additional to the LEGO Building Competition, we have presentations and tables to give information about FIRST Programs in our town, and invite local FLL teams to demonstrate their robots alongside our own.</p>

        <b>MOORESTOWN DAY / AUTUMN IN MOORESTOWN</b>
        <p>Every year, our town hosts "Moorestown Day" and "Autumn in Moorestown," events in which our main street is shut down and filled with booths for stores, organizations, and restaurants. Our team has held a booth at these events for the past four years, showing off our robot to our community. We offer the ability to drive the robot to kids, and offer face painting.</p>
